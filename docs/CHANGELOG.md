## 2026-08-16 — Milestone 1 completion (opencode)

Continued from the Gemini session log (removed on 2026-08-16; its content is
captured in this file, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

Verified from code that the Gemini session's new `src/`/`packages/` layout,
root `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `esbuild.config.js` existed, then
closed the remaining gaps:

- **Removed legacy `backend/`** (FastAPI, faster-whisper, deep-translator
  Python backend) — Python is no longer part of the MVP.
- **Removed legacy `electron/`** directory (JS/JSX app + its own
  `node_modules`). This also fixed `npm run type-check`, which failed with
  TS2459/TS2305 on `electron` imports because the legacy CommonJS
  `electron/main.js` was breaking the `electron` module types.
- **Fixed the build**: `esbuild.config.js` now copies
  `src/renderer/index.html` → `dist/renderer/index.html`. Previously the
  main process loaded a nonexistent `dist/renderer/index.html`.
- **Typed IPC foundation**: added `ElectronAPI` to `packages/shared/index.ts`;
  `src/preload/index.ts` and `src/main/index.ts` now use it; added
  `src/renderer/types/electron.d.ts`; `App.tsx` reads the initial status
  through `window.electron.getAppStatus()` on mount, exercising the secure
  bridge at runtime.
- **Created `.env.example`**.
- **Rewrote `README.md`** to document the Node.js-only architecture and
  Milestone 1 status (was still describing the Python + Electron architecture).
- **Removed obsolete Python-era docs**: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api.md`,
  `docs/setup.md`.
- **Established the permanent documentation workflow**:
  - Rewrote `AGENTS.md` (agent instructions + required reading/writing of docs).
  - Created `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`,
    `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (renamed from `docs/architecture.md`).

- **Upgraded Electron `^31.0.0` → `^42.4.0` (installed `42.9.1`)**: the
  Electron 31.7.7 macOS binary is blocked by a 2026 macOS XProtect update
  that flags stale/unsigned Electron builds as malware — it shows
  `"Electron" was not opened because it contains malware`, kills the process
  (SIGKILL), and deletes `Electron.app` from `node_modules`. Electron
  42.x runs cleanly (verified: `npx electron --version` and the smoke test).
  This is a known XProtect false positive, not real malware.

Validation: `npm run type-check` passes, `npm run build` succeeds and produces
`dist/renderer/index.html`, an automated Electron smoke test loads the real
renderer through the real preload bridge and gets `'idle'` via IPC
(`SMOKE_PASS`), and the app launched via `npx electron .` stays alive with no
errors.

Leftovers intentionally not touched: `project_readme.md` (old pre-migration
readme backup), `.aider.*` files, `.DS_Store`.

## 2026-08-16 — Milestone 1 migration work (Gemini session)

Recorded in a Gemini session log (removed on 2026-08-16; content captured in
this file and `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`). Created the Node.js/TypeScript
architecture:

- Root `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `esbuild.config.js`.
- `src/main/index.ts` (Electron main, secure webPreferences).
- `src/preload/index.ts` (contextBridge IPC bridge).
- `src/renderer/` React + TypeScript UI shell (App, HomeScreen,
  LiveTranslationScreen, SubtitleDisplay, StatusBar, App.css).
- `packages/shared/index.ts` shared types.
- Ran `npm install`, `npm run build`.

Left incomplete (finished by the opencode entry above): removing
`backend/`/`electron/`, `dist/renderer/index.html` copy, `.env.example`,
documentation rewrite, and type-check fixing.

## 2026-06 — Original implementation (pre-docs history)

Legacy commits built the original Electron + React (JS) app with a Python
FastAPI backend (`backend/`) for Whisper transcription and translation. Both
were removed during Milestone 1.
